PUSH_SWAP

The goal of push swap is to sort a list of number using 2 stacks with a limited allowed operation. To check if the numbers has actually been sorted or not, this project has been provided a checker.
Both should have the same argument and the standard output from push_swap should be binded to the checker's standard input.
